# Food_delivery_project
This project made with Django REST Framework on backend and will be added with React on frontend (future addition). 

User can register, create your account and choose user_type - Customer, Courier, Cook or Manager.
For booking purpose user can add your card with validate card number.

Manager can add new menu items, update and delete ones.

<i>Future plans:</i> <br />
I want to implement orders logic, user can order some food and couriers can deliver it to users.
